The observation of sub-wavelength structures with microscopes is difficult because of the **Abbe Limit**. Ernst Abbe found in 1873, and expressed as a formula in 1882, that [[Light]] with [[Wavelength]] $\lambda$, traveling in a medium with refractive index $n$ and converging to a spot with half-angle $\theta$ will have a minimum resolvable distance of 
$$
d = \frac{\lambda}{2n\sin\theta} = \frac{\lambda}{2\ \text{NA}}
$$
for general purposes, just let NA $= 1$:
$$d \approx \frac{\lambda}{2}$$
