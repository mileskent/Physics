Due to quantum fluctuations, particle-[[Antimatter|antiparticle]] pairs are created near the even horizon. One particle falls into the singularity as the other escapes. Antiparticles that escape will emit [[Light]] when they [[Pair Annihilation|annihilate]] with matter.

The heavier the black hole, the less power it radiates.

The [[Blackbody Radiation]] and temperature of a black hole are
$$
T = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi k_{B} GM}
$$
$$
P(T) = 4\pi r^2_S \sigma T^4
$$
See [[Schwarzschild Radius]], [[Stefan-Boltzmann Law]]

The lifetime of a black hole is:
$$
\tau_{\text{black hole}} = \frac{5120\pi G^{2}}{\hbar c^{4}} M^3
$$
