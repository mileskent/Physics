Also called "Bracket/Bra-ket" Notation

$$
\langle g(x) \rangle = \int \psi^*(x)\ g(x) \ \psi(x)\ dx = \langle \psi\ | \ g\ |\ \psi \rangle
$$
The entire expression $\langle \psi\ | \ g\ |\ \psi \rangle$ is called the "bracket"
 $\langle \psi|$ is called the "bra"
 $| \psi \rangle$ is called the "ket"

* For example, the expected position $x$ is $\langle \psi\ | \ x\ |\ \psi \rangle$
* To include time dependence: $\langle g(x, t) \rangle = \langle \Psi\ | \ g(x, t)\ |\ \Psi \rangle$
* The normalization condition is $\langle \Psi\ |\ \Psi \rangle = \langle \psi\ |\ \psi \rangle = 1$
* The dipole moment: $\langle \vec{d}\rangle = \langle \psi_{f} \ | \ e \vec{r} \ |\ \psi_{i} \rangle$
