A theory by Einstein to fix the messiness of [[Maxwell's Equations]] in moving [[Inertial Reference Frame]]s under [[Galilean Transformation]]s.

> * [[Light]] does not require a medium
> * All laws of physics are the same in all [[Inertial Reference Frame|Intertial Reference Frames]]
#### The Paper
> [!info]- The full contents of his paper
> 0. [[Light]] does not require a medium; waves could be fundamental just a particles are. This is his "0th" point because it is not made as a primary postulate but is neccessary for the rest to follow
> 1. The Principal of Relativity
> 	* All law of physics (emphasis on [[Maxwell's Equations]]) are the same in all [[Inertial Reference Frame]]s. 
> 		$\implies$ There is no way to detect absolute motion
> 		$\implies$ No preferred inertial system exists.
> 		$\implies$ Constant speed of light (See No. 2)
> 2.	The [[Speed of Light]] is constant (in a vacuum)
> 	* This is implied by the previous point due to [[Maxwell's Equations]] being the same in all [[Inertial Reference Frame]]s
> 
#### Implications
* Constant [[Speed of Light]]
* Explains [[Michelson-Morley Experiment]] null results
* [[Time Dilation]]
	* Contradicts [[Galilean Transformation]] shared time
* [[Lorentz Contraction]]
* [[Relativistic Momentum]]
* [[Relativistic Energy]]
