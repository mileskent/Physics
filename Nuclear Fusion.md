Colliding two *small* [[Atom|atomic]] nuclei together can result in
* A larger, combined nucleus
* Even more energy than [[Nuclear Fission]]
* With even more energy (10s of millions Kelvin) can create an even more powerful nuclear weapon, i.e. a fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb if powered by hydrogen)
	* It is a bomb within a bomb within a bomb
		* Fission bomb detonated by typical high explosive
		* Fusion bomb detonated by Fission bomb
	* Harnessing fusion energy for energy generation purposes has been unsuccessful
