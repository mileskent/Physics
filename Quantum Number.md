The 3 quantum numbers:
* $n$ is the principal quantum number
* $l$ is the ortbial angular momentum quantum number
* $m_l$ is the magnetic (azimuthal) quantum number
The constraints of the quantum numbers are as follows:
$$
n, l, m_{l} \in \mathbb{Z}
\quad \quad
n > 0
\quad \quad
l < n
\quad \quad
|m_{l}| \leq l
$$
* Total number of states is $n^2$
* Higher values of $n$ correspond to higher orbits from the nucleus, by a factor of $n$
* $E_{n} = -\frac{E_{0}}{n^2}$, $E_{0} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu a_{0}^2}$
* Energy only depends on $n$, therefore $l$ and $m_l$ can vary while maintaining a constant energy. This means there are a lot of *degenerate* states!
