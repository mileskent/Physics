#### Absorption Coefficient $\alpha$
Absorption coefficient maximal on resonance
Atoms and molecules have many resonance freq
Refractive index
Resonance freq $\omega_0$, Widths $\Gamma$
High Resolution Visible Solar Absorption Spectrum
	Molecules have more states than atoms and thus have more complex spectra
#### The colors of things
Wavelengths that an object does not absorb determine its color
#### How we perceive the world
Materials transparent in one light spectrum are opaque in another, e.g. glass becomes opaque beyond the visible spectrum
#### Human Tissue
Different wavelength light have different penetration into the body
Oximetry
	Oximeters measure oxygen content of blood, and pulse rates, based on absorption on different wavelengths
#### Air Absorption
$I(z) = I(0) exp(-\alpha z)$
Attenuation...
Optical Density....
#### Greenhouse Effect
Windows are transpartent in the visible but opaque in the IR. The glass absorbs the IR photons.
Methane 20x more absorbing than Carbon Dioxide
CFC, HCFC, $N_2 O$, $CH_4$, also water but that is essential for life
Global Warming, Record highs, Major storms, More precipitation, More wildfires, More drought, Glacial Retreat, Ocean acidity/warming

#### Albedo
Reflectivity of a substance
$$
\text{Albedo} = \frac{\text{reflected light}}{\text{incident light}}
$$
