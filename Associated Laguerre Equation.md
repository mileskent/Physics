Solutions are products of decaying exponentials and Associated Laguerre polynomials. There are infinitely many of these polynomials for $n = [1, \infty],\ l = [0, n - 1]$

$n = 1, l = 0$ gives the solution the the ground state equation for Hydrogen.
$$
a_{0} = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar^2}{\mu e^2}
\quad\quad
E = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu a_{0}^2}
$$
Same as [[Bohr Model]]'s results!
