All [[Antimatter]] eventually meets the same fate: annihilation. 
* A lot of [[Relativistic Energy|energy is released in the process]], and annihilation is the most efficient way to generate energy, as 100% of the mass is converted into energy, as opposed to the ~1% of nuclear energy.
* An [[Electron]] and [[Positron]] can collide, and annihilate one another. They decay into two opposite direction [[Photon]]s, in empty space to conserve momentum.
$$
e^+ + e^- \rightarrow 2\gamma
$$
* If there is matter that transfers energy, then it could be a single photon.
