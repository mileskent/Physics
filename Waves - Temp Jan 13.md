#todo Go back and rewatch lecture
only writing down topics

### Wave Equation
Restoring force = $\gamma \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$
#todo missed content, wave equation, explanation

Waves can pass through each without affecting eachother --- principle of superposition
They maintain their shape
waves can be added together

$f(x, t) = Acos([k(x - vt) - \theta])$
#todo missed whole harmonic wave slide

#todo Amplitude and absolute/initial phase

##### Spatial Quantities 
* wavelength $\lambda$
* wave number $\kappa$

##### Temporal Quantities 
* period $\tau$
* angular frequency $\omega$
* cyclical frequency $\nu$

Phase velocity
$v = \frac{\lambda}{\tau}$

Phase of a wave is everything inside the cosine
$f(x, t) = A \cos \phi$ where $\phi(x, t) = kx - \omega t - \theta$
