Planck's investigation of the [[Blackbody Radiation]] spectra of hot objects and the subsequent studies into the [[Photoelectric Effect]] had proven that [[Light]] was capable of behaving both as a wave and as a particle. It seemed reasonable to wonder if electrons could also have a dual wave-particle ([[Wavicle]]) nature. In 1924, French scientist Louis de Broglie (1892-1987) derived an equation that described the [[Wave]] nature of any particle. Particularly, the [[Wavelength]] (λ) of any moving object is given by:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
Related equivalences (only applicable for [[Light]]):
$$p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{h\nu}{c} = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \hbar k$$
where $h$ is the [[Planck constant]]
where $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
where $k$ is the [[K Vector]]
