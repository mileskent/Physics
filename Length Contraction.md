Observing another reference frame in relative motion, objects will appear contracted.

* Only occurs for the length in the direction of the velocity, not those perpindular to it.
* Is a reciprocal/symmetric effect just like [[Time Dilation]]
* Very related to [[Time Dilation]]

> [!tip] Why Contraction?
> $K$ is the stationary reference frame, while $K'$ is the one is relative motion.
> We want the length measured from $K'$ in terms of the [[Proper Length]]
> 
> $L_{0}$ is the [[Proper Length]] given by $\Delta x$
> $L'$ is given by $\Delta x'$, measured from $K'$ by 2 observers simulateously -> $\Delta t' = 0$
> Because we are given the $K'$ relevant information we use the inverse
> $$
> \begin{align}
> \Delta x = \gamma (\Delta x' - v \Delta t') \\
> L_{0} = \gamma(L' - 0) \\
> L' = \frac{1}{\gamma} L_{0}
