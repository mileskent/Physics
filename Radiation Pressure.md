See [[Relativistic Momentum]] and [[Relativistic Force]]

Because [[Light]] has [[Relativistic Momentum|momentum]], it can impart that momentum to bodies in space. Such is radiation pressure. Objects floating in the void of space, if devoid of external forces except for light, will start to drift. Such calculations are crucial for space travel calculations.

Pressure is measured in Pascals and is force per unit area.

$$
\text{Pressure} = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{dp}{dt} \frac{1}{A} = \frac{I}{c}
$$
