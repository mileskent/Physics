### Quantum Mechanical [[Wave]] Functions
I understand this mathematically but not conceptually, in terms of the [[Wave Equation]]

### Expectation Value
The **expectation value** $\langle x\rangle$ is the weight average of a given quantity. In general, the expect value of $x$ is 
$$
\text{For discrete possibilities: }\quad
\langle x \rangle = \sum_{i} P_{i} x_{i}
$$
$$
\text{For infinite possibilities: }\quad
\langle x \rangle = \int P(x) x\ dx =  \int |\psi(x)^2| x\ dx = \int \psi(x)^* \psi(x) x\ dx
$$
Note $P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2$

For some function with infinite possibilities the expectation value is
$$
\langle g(x) \rangle = \int \psi^*(x)\ g(x) \ \psi(x)\ dx
$$

### Uncertainty in Quantum Mechanics
* Classical measurement error
* [[Probability Distribution Functions|Probabilistic quantities]]
* [[Uncertainty Principle]]
* [[Observer Effect]]
* State is usually unknown
Note [[Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox]]
