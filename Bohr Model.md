1. Electrons reside in *stationary states* and do *not* radiate energy. They have well-defined energies: $E_{n}$ where $n \in\mathbb{Z}^+$
	Transitions can occur between them yielding light of energy: $E = E_{n} - E_{n'} = h \nu$
	where $E_{n} < E_{n'}$ is aborption and $E_{n} > E_{n'}$ is emission
2. Classical laws of physics don't apply to transistions between stationary states, but they do apply elsewhere
3. The angular momentum of the $n^{\text{th}}$ state is $n \hbar$, where $n$ is call the *Principal Quantum Number*

#### Consequences
$$
L = mvr = n\hbar
\quad \implies \quad
v_{\text{electron}} = \frac{n\hbar}{mr}
$$
$v_{\text{electron}} = \frac{e}{\sqrt{ 4\pi \epsilon_{0}mr }}$ from planetary model
Set equal to eachother you get
$$
r_{n} = n^2 a_{0}
\quad
\text{where}\ a_{0} = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar^2}{me^2}
$$
$a_{0}$ is called the *Bohr radius*, which is the radius of the Hydrogen atom in its lowest energy state.

More specifically 
$$
(v_{\text{electron}})_{n} = \frac{n\hbar}{mr_{n}} = \frac{1}{n} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} \hbar} = \frac{1}{n}\ c\ \alpha
$$
See [[Fine Structure Constant]]

Emission of lighty occurs when the atom is in an excited state and decays to a lower energy state ($n_u \rightarrow n_{l}$)
$$
h \nu = E_{u} - E_{l}
$$
where $\nu$ is the frequency of the emitted photon

Can be used to derive the [[Rydberg Equation]]

#### Limits
Assumes that the nucleus has infinite mass. In reality, the nucleus wobbles with the motion of the electron. In order to account for this motion, use the reduced mass of the electron
###### Bohr Reduced Mass of Electron
$$
\mu_{e} = \frac{{m_{e}}}{1 + \frac{m_{e}}{M_n}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{m_{e}+\frac{1}{M_{n}}}}
$$
**Only works for Hydrogen atoms and other single electron atoms**

Doesn't explain other natural phenomena
