The closed loop line integral of a magnetic field is proportional to the current the loop encloses. Right hand rule dictates the sign of the integral. Over a stationary path.
$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_{0}(\frac{dq}{dt} + \epsilon \frac{d \Phi_E}{dt})=\mu_{0}(i_{encl.} + i_{displ.})$$
$$\oint B \cdot dl = \mu_{0}I_{enclosed}$$
There are a variety of [[Common Cases of Amp√®re's Law]].
