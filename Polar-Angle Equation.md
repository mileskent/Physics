$$
\frac{1}{\sin \theta} \frac{d}{d \theta} \left( \sin \theta  \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) + \left[ l(l + 1) - \frac{m^2_{l}}{\sin^2 \theta} \right]f = 0
$$
Has solutions called *Legendre Polynomials* of sines and cosines.

Note $m_l$ and how the solutions to the [[Schr√∂dinger Wave Equation#Azimuthal-angle equation|Azimuthal equation]] also depend on this quantity. Therefore the solutions between the two are related.

We usually group these solutions together into functions called *Spherical Harmonics*:
$$
Y_{l_{m_{l}}}(\theta, \phi) = f_{l_{m_{l}}} (\theta) g_{m_{l}}(\phi) = f_{l_{m_{l}}} \exp(i m_{l} \phi)
$$
