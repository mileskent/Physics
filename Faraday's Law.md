The [[EMF]] around a closed path is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic [[Flux]] enclosed by the path.
$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d \Phi_B}{dt}$$
Accordingly, a [[Solenoid]] with $N$ total turns will have an EMF $N$ times as large as that induced by just one of its loops:
$$\mathcal{E} = -N\frac{d \Phi_B}{dt}$$
Of a rotating loop with $N$ total turns and angular velocity $\omega$:
$$\mathcal{E} = -N\frac{d \Phi_{B}}{dt} = NBA \omega sin(\omega t)$$
Of a rectangular current loop with one side of length $L$ that is moving at velocity $v$ right such that the loop is growing, in a uniform magnetic field into the page.
$$\mathcal{E} = vBL$$
## Stationary Faraday's Law
If the surface is not changing with time:
$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{l} = -\frac{d \Phi_B}{dt}$$
The right hand side of the equation is a special case of the right hand side of the [[Maxwell-Faraday Equation]] for
