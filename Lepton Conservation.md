A conservation law of [[Quantum Mechanics]] that states:
	The number of [[Lepton]]s from each family is conserved
Used for particle interaction
# Lepton Number
### Electron
For [[Electron]] and [[Electron Neutrino]]
$$
L_{e} = [-1, 0, 1]
$$
* $L_{e} = 1$ is for electrons
* $L_{e} = -1$ is for electron neutrinos
* $L_{e} = 0$ for all other particles
### Muon 
For [[Muon]] and [[Muon Neutrino]]
$$
L_{\mu} = same
$$
### Tau 
For [[Tau]] and [[Tau Neutrino]]
$$
L_{\tau} = same
$$
