A laser is a medium that stores energy, surroudned by two mirrors. A partially reflecting output mirror lets some light out.

* Emits [[Plane Wave]]s

## Gain
$$
G \equiv \exp(\sigma(N_{2} - N_{1}) L )
$$
$g, \alpha$ are gain and absorption coefficients
$$
N_{2} < N_{1} \rightarrow \alpha \equiv (N_{1}-N_{2}) \sigma
\quad\quad
N_{2} > N_{1} \rightarrow g \equiv (N_{2}-N_{1}) \sigma
$$

### Saturation Intensity
$$
I_{\text{saturation}} = \frac{\hbar\omega}{\sigma \tau}
$$
