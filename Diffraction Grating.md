An object with periodic optical properties, e.g. grooves. 
Seperates light into its component wavelengths through the process of diffraction and interference.
* Think of the way a CD looks. This is because it is a [[Diffraction Grating]]

Construcive coherent intereference occurs if 
$$\Large
k(AB - CD) = 2(m \in \mathbb{Z})\pi
$$
#### Diffraction Grating Equation
$$\Large
a(\sin(\theta_{m}) - \sin(\theta_{i})) = m \lambda
$$
