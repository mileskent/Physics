Also called "Associated Laguerre Equation"
Solutions are products of decaying exponentials and Associated Laguerre polynomials. There are infinitely many of these polynomials for $n = [1, \infty],\ l = [0, n - 1]$

$$
\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \frac{dR}{dr} \right) + \frac{2\mu}{\hbar^2}
\left[E + \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} - \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}\right] R = 0
$$
See [[Hydrogen Radial Wave Functions]] which are solutions to this

For example
$n = 1, l = 0$ gives the solution the the ground state equation for Hydrogen.
$$
a_{0} = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar^2}{\mu e^2}
\quad\quad
E = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu a_{0}^2}
$$
Same as [[Bohr Model]]'s results!
