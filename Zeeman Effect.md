A [[Magnetic Field]] can split a single [[Spectral Lines|spectral line]] into multiple lines.
$$
V_{B} = - \vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B}
\quad\quad\text{where }
\vec{\mu} = - \frac{e}{2m} \vec{L}
$$

If the magnetic field is in the z direction, all that matters is the z component of $\mu$
$$
\mu_{z} = - \frac{e}{2m} L_{z} = - \frac{e}{2m} (m_{l}\hbar) = -\mu_{B}m_{l}
\quad\quad\text{where } \mu_{B} = \frac{e\hbar}{2m}
$$
See [[Operator#Angular Momentum Operator]]. $\mu_{B}$ is called the *Bohr magneton*

* An electron with angular momentum gnerates a magnetic field, which has lower energy when aligned antiparallel to an applied magnetic field than when aligned parallel to it.
