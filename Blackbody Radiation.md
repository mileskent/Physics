Black-body radiation is the light emitted by a hot body.
### Blackbody Spectral Irradiance
$$
I_{\nu} = \frac{8\pi h\frac{\nu^3}{c^2}}{\exp\left( \frac{h\nu}{k_{B}} \right)- 1}
$$

### Black Body Irradiance per Wavelength
$$
I_{\lambda}(\lambda) = \frac{8\pi h \frac{c^2}{\lambda^5}}{\exp\left( \frac{hc}{\lambda k_{B}T}  \right)-1}

### Total Emitted Blackbody Irradiance
The [[Stefan-Boltzmann Law]]
$$
I_{\text{total}} = \sigma T^4
\quad\quad \text{where } \sigma = \frac{2\pi^5k_{B}^4}{15h^3c^2}
$$
Multiply by surface area to get emitted power.

### [[Wien's Law]]
$$
\text{Peak wavelength} \propto \frac{1}{T}
$$
