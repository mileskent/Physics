All observers see the same [[Speed of Light]], so all observers must see spherical wave fronts from a point source of light, regardless of their velocities.
$$
s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -c^2t^2 = 
x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 -c'^2t'^2 = s'^2
$$
So
$$
\Delta s^2 = \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2 - c^2 \Delta t^2
$$
### Cases
$\Delta s^2 = 0$
* $\Delta x^2 = c^2 \Delta t^2$ and the two events can be conencted only by a light signal. The events are said to have a **light-like** separation
$\Delta s^2 > 0$
* $\Delta x^2 > c^2 \Delta t^2$ and so no signal can travel fast enough to connect the two events. The events are not causally connected and are said to have **space-like** separation
$\Delta s^2 < 0$
* $\Delta x^2 < c^2 \Delta t^2$  and so the two events can be causally connect. The interval is said to be **time-like**
