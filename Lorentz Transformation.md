A modification of [[Galilean Transformation|Galilean Transformations]] which accounts for [[Special Relativity]]
$$
\begin{align}
x' = \gamma (x - vt) & \quad\quad x = \gamma (x' - vt') \\
y' = y & \quad\quad y' = y\\
z' = z & \quad\quad z' = z\\
t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right)& \quad\quad 
t = \gamma \left( t' - \frac{vx'}{c^2} \right)\\
\end{align}
$$
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} }} \quad\quad (\gamma \in \mathbb{R})\geq 1
$$

### [[Time Dilation]] vs [[Lorentz Contraction]]
Why is a reference frame that is moving relative to a stationary observer
Dilated (multiplied) by $\gamma$ for time, but contracted (divided) by $\gamma$ for length?

Each measurement involves its own special conditions.
* Time
	* $x_{2}=x_{1}$
	* $x_{2}' \not = x_{1}'$
	* Must use [[Lorentz Transformation]]
* Length
	* $t_{1}'=t_{2}'$
	* $t_{1} \not = t_{2}$  
		* (really they could be anything, but they don't strictly need to be equal)
	* Must use [[Lorentz Transformation|Inverse Lorentz Transformation]]
